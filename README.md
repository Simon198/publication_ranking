# Publication Ranking
A small python script to check the ranking of publications.

The rankings are parsed from the plattforms [Core](https://www.core.edu.au/) & [TSV](https://www.tsv.fi/)
The best ranking Core gives is a A*. The best ranking TSV gives is 3.

## Presettings
To run this the script, you need to download the Firefox geckodriver and store in the same directory as the script. Otherwise you need to update the path to the driver in the script itself.
